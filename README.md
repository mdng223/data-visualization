# data-visualization

- This project in the simplest of terms will be a CRUD web application and data warehouse for personal needs of any user
- This will act as a base foundation to strengthen my development skills in terms of implementing and experimenting with various development tools. 

# Data
### The type of data this application can handle is extremely small in scale right now due to the foundation of this web application being a work in progress. Starting with financial data.
- Users
- Loans
- 401k
- Roth
- HSA



## Built With

* [.NET Core 2.2.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2) - Backend Framework.
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) -  HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
* [Microsoft SQLServer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx) - relational database management system.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
* [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - Client side router used in conjunction with Vue.js. I opted to use this for quicker and smoother routing between views. 
* [Entity Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_Framework) -  object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. I opted to use this over using SPROCS because it's easier to query and I don't have complex data queries as of yet. 
* [Axios.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Library used to make HTTP requests and for its use of Promises

## Acknowledgments

* I opted to use .NET to prove that I am competant in being able to work with this framework, as it is in demand in industry
* I think a Javascript backend framework would be better because I would not be limited on front-end impplementation. 
* I am not able to use [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Babel/Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill), [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/), and other libraries because of this. 
* Not spending too much time on backend data validation because the data isn't super sensitive and front-end data validation is superior for user experience

## Currently Working on

* Converting all my server side rendered pages to client side rendered pages
* Making all the necessary components
* Keeping the backend simple. Will handle querying data pretty much. 

## Future Works
* Incorporating [D3](https://d3js.org/) aka Data-Driven-Documents for data visualization once my data scales.
* I will add data sciency techniques once I learn them to prove compentancy down the road.
